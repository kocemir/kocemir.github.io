I am a graduate research assistant in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department at Bilkent University, under the supervision of Assist. Prof. Aykut Koç. I hold an M.Sc. degree from Bilkent University and a B.Sc. degree from Sabancı University. My primary research interests include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Signal Processing, with a particular emphasis on their statistical and mathematical foundations. My objective is to develop intelligent learning systems that can be seamlessly integrated into multidisciplinary research frameworks.

During my undergraduate studies, I gained practical experience in the development of advanced deep learning-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. During my master's studies, I worked at the intersection of signal processing, time series analysis, image processing, and natural language processing. Currently, my research focuses on graph neural networks and large language models, and their applications across diverse domains. <strong>Building upon my broad experience across multiple fields, I am open to research opportunities in AI and machine learning applications in science, medicine, healthcare, and computational biology.</strong>
