  title={scGraPhT: Merging Transformers and Graph Neural Networks for Single-Cell Annotation}, 
  year={2025},
  abstract={Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique for understanding cellular heterogeneity. However, the high dimensionality and sparsity of scRNA-seq data pose significant challenges for accurate cell type annotation. In this paper, we introduce scGraPhT, a novel framework that combines the strengths of transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance single-cell annotation. The proposed method constructs a graph representation of single-cell data, where nodes represent cells and edges capture relationships based on gene expression similarity. A transformer-based architecture is then employed to learn rich representations of these graphs, enabling effective cell type classification. Experimental results demonstrate that scGraPhT outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness across various datasets. Our approach provides a promising direction for improving single-cell analysis through advanced graph-based techniques.},
