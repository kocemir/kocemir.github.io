  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={scGraPhT: Merging Transformers and Graph Neural Networks for Single-Cell Annotation}, 
  year={2025},
  abstract={Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique for understanding cellular heterogeneity. However, the high dimensionality and sparsity of scRNA-seq data pose significant challenges for accurate cell type annotation. In this paper, we introduce scGraPhT, a novel framework that combines the strengths of transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance single-cell annotation. The proposed method constructs a graph representation of single-cell data, where nodes represent cells and edges capture relationships based on gene expression similarity. A transformer-based architecture is then employed to learn rich representations of these graphs, enabling effective cell type classification. Experimental results demonstrate that scGraPhT outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness across various datasets. Our approach provides a promising direction for improving single-cell analysis through advanced graph-based techniques.},
